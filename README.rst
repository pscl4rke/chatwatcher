ChatWatcher
===========

When complete this project will provide a daemon that sits in
a Jabber chat room and then runs custom commands based on the
messages that come through the chat.

This project will have achieved its main goal when the office
bear can read out all messages (courtesy of ``festival --tts``).

Installation
------------

Ha!  That's still to be organised.  However I can tell you:

Requirements:

-   SleekXMPP (https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP)
